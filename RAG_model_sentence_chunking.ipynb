Referring to Sub-Clause 5 .2 of GC if the Employer desires the Bidder to use the \\nservices of nominated subcontractor(s), the Employer should make necessary \\nprovisions of Provisional Sums  \\nSuitable text referring to such provisions should be added under the Sub-Clause.  \\nvi. Referring to Sub-Clause 8.2 of GC, the Employer should specify the Time for \\nCompletion  for the Works or the Sections (as the case may be) in the Contract Data \\nwhich should be reasonable with respect to size and complexity of the Works  and \\navailable resources . \\nvii. Referring to Sub-Clause 8.3 of GC, the Employer should specify the form in which the \\nProgramme is to be submitted by the Bidder, e.g., critical path network /CPM , simple \\nbar chart or PERT , preferably BIM (Building Information Modelling).  \\nviii. In case the Employer considers that if completion by the Contractor of the whole \\nWorks, or of any S ection thereof, earlier than the specified completion time will be of \\nsubstantial benefit to him, he may add a Sub-Clause 8.14 “Bonus for Early \\nCompletion”. The amount of daily bonus should be half of the rates specified for the \\namount of daily liquidated damages . A ceiling of total bonus (say, 5 percent of \\nContract Price) may be inserted to discourage unrealistically rapid Contract \\nimplementation by the Contractor, which could adversely affect overall performance.  \\nix.

Referring to Clause 21 of GC, the Employer shall decide the provision of “a sole \\nMember ” or “Three Members ” DAAB and venue of Arbitration, which should be \\nwithin the Employer’s country/project location. This Clause is applicable at the option \\nof the Employer to select Arbitration Act 1940 including any rule made thereunder or  \\nin accordance with the UNCITRAL model -based PEC Rules of Conciliation and \\nArbitration, when notified .  \\nG. Specifications  Part A - Speci fic Provisions  \\nTo be prepared and incorporated by the Employer. Inclusion of the Conditions of Contract  \\nand/or any stipulation of item of work not provided under BoQ,  should be avoided.  \\nH. Specifications  Part B - Technical Provisions  \\nTo be prepared and incorporated by the Employer.  \\n(Precise and clear Specifications are prerequisite for Bidders to respond realistically and \\ncompetitively to the requirements of the Employer without qualifying or conditioning their \\nbids. In the context of both national and international competitive bidding, the \\nSpecifications must be drafted to permit the widest possible competition and, at the same \\ntime, present a clear statement of the required standards of materials, Plant, other supplies, \\nand workmanship to be provided. Only if this is done , the objectives of economy, efficiency  \\nand equality in procurement be realized, responsiveness of bids be ensured, and the \\nsubsequent task of bid evaluation be facilitated. The Specifications should require that  all \\nmaterials, Plant, and other supplies to be incorporated in the Works are new, unused, of the Instructions to Employers         xv \\n \\n \\nmost recent or current models, and incorporate all recent improvements in design and \\nmaterials unless provided otherwise in the Contract. A clause setting out the scope of the \\nWorks is often included at the beginning of the Specifications, and it is customary to give a \\nlist of the Drawings. Where the Contractor is responsible for the design of any part of the \\npermanent Works, the extent of his obligations must be stated.  \\nAny terms, s pecifications, standards, features, characteristics and requirements prescribing \\nthe technical or quality characteristics  shall be generic in nature and shall not include \\nreferences to brand names, model numbers, catalogue numbers , name or origin of the \\ncountry or similar classifications. In case the Employer is convinced that the use of or a \\nreference to a brand name or a catalogue number is essential to complete , an otherwise \\nincomplete specification, and no other sufficiently precise or understandable way of \\ndescribing the characteristics of the goods, works or services to be procured is provided, \\nsuch use or reference shall be qualified with the words “or equivalent”.  However, the \\nEmployer shall define the parameters of “equivalence” in th e Specifications to ensure \\ntrans parency.  A justification of using brand names, model numbers, catalogue numbers , \\nname or origin of the country or similar classifications  may be placed in the procurement \\nfile prior to inviting bids.  \\nCare must be taken in drafting Specifications to ensure that they are not restrictive. In the \\nspecification of standards for materials, Plant, other supplies, and workmanship, recognized \\ninternational standards should be used as much as possible. The specifications shall \\nconsider all site conditions but not limited to seismic conditions, weather conditions and \\nenvironmental impact. Where other particular standards are used, whether national \\nstandards or other standards, the Specifications should state that materials, Plant, other \\nsupplies, and workmanship meeting other authoritative standards, and which ensure equal \\nperformance, as the standards mentioned, will also be acceptable.  \\nThe following Sub-Clauses of Conditions of Contract make express reference to matters to \\nbe stated in the Specification and/or Drawings. However, it may also be necessary under \\nother Sub-Clauses for the Employer to give  specific information in the Specifications  (for \\nexample, under Sub-Clause 7.2 [Samples]).  \\n1.8 Care and Supply of Documents . \\n1.13 Compliance with Laws . \\n2.1 Right of Access to the Site . \\n2.5 Site Data and Items of Reference.  \\n2.6 Employer -Supplied Materials and Employer's Equipment . \\n4.1 Contractor's General Obligations . \\n4.4 Contractor's Documents . \\n4.5 Training . \\n4.6 Co-operation.  \\n4.8 Health and Safety Obligations . \\n4.9 Quality Management and Compliance Verification Systems . \\n4.16 Transport of Goods . \\n4.18 Protection of the Environment . \\n4.19 Temporary Utilities . \\n4.20 Progress Reports . \\n5.2 Nom inated Subcontractors . \\n6.1 Engagement of Staff and Labour.  \\n6.6 Facilities for Staff and Labour. \\n6.7 Health and Safety of Personnel . \\n\\n    Query: What is performance security\", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]\n",
